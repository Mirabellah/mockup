              <strong> Color Scheme: <br>
              </strong>The colors we chose are playing an important role in our brand's identity and personality. Our website use the shades of yellow (#FFCF00), blue (#C4DDEF), light green (#D9E0A2), dark green (#485613), light brown(#DBB377) and complementary colors such as white (#FFF) and black (#000) for text contrast.
 <br><br>
#FFCF00 The bright yellow color refers to the sun shining. #C4DDEF refers to a blue sky. These two colors combined resemble a time where the weather is nice for dogs and their owners to take a beautiful walk. According to our interviews pet owners have the most enjoyment with their dogs during a walk with nice weather, therefore we choose colors that evokes this feeling. #D9E0A2 This light green refers to the favourite kind of playground for every single dog, good amount of fresh grass. #485613 The dark green shows the dirt every dog loves playing in. #DBB377 The light brown resembles dogs and dogfood. Many of our colours were chosen by looking at certain elements that dogs like, because we have learned from our interviews that a happy dogs makes a happy dog owner.
 <br><br>
Additionally, according to research, the colors we use evoke feelings of energy, trustworthiness, happiness. For example yellow is associated with warmth and happiness. Based on feedback from participants who tested our website, the color yellow was mentioned as a significant factor contributing to happiness. They said that they felt more happier and more uplifted when encountering this color scheme. Light blue gave the participants a relaxing, trustworthy feeling. This aligns with the brand's values and personality. Similarly, they noted that the color light green contributed to a sense of freshness and tranquility during their  experience. Light brown added a sense of warmth, comfort, and reliability to the design. All of this is also aligns with the values of our brand.
			<br> <br>
		We use the rubik, gluten and sans serif fonts for our website hereby the justification:
<br><br>
 <strong>Rubik Font:</strong>
    Rubik font is modern, clean, and approachable. It reflects the value of customer transparency by being easy to read and straightforward, mirroring the clarity you aim to provide to your customers.
    Its geometric design suggests structure and organization, which can signify trustworthiness and reliability wich is imoortant for transparency in our services.
  <br>
	<strong>Gluten Font:</strong>
    Gluten font is often associated with friendliness and warmth. Its handwritten style adds a personal touch, which is suitable for creating a sense of community among pet owners and sitters.
    By using Gluten font, we convey a welcoming atmosphere within our local pet community, encouraging communication and sharing among our audience.
				<br>
   <strong> Sans Serif Font :</strong>
    Sans serif fonts are known for their simplicity and versatility. They are easy to read across different mediums and sizes, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity.
				<br> <br>	
				
	<strong>How does website design fit the values and personality of the brand?</strong>

<br> <br>				
The values of our brand are:
Customer transparency
Our brand is creating a new form of pet sitting where pet owners invite guests to take care of their pet for a certain amount of time. Transparency is necessary to create a sense of safety between pet owners, pet sitters and their pets.
Bringing together local pet owners
Create a local pet community where our audience can communicate and share their passion for pets.
Pet, pet owner and pet sitter wellbeing
We work hard to ensure the wellbeing of our audience which is pets, pet owners and pet sitters. We want to create a comfortable and safe experience.
With these values, we aim to create a feeling of happiness. We aim to achieve this feeling by creating comfort and trust between our brand, pet owners and pet sitters. The design of the website fits well with this, for instance, since it is very easy to use. Immediately when you open our website you can fill in your location, departure, return, and number of pets and click on the search icon. For pet owners it is very easy to find the pet sitter they need. In addition to this, it is also easy for pet sitters to start on Sit&amp;Stay, since the login page for pet sitters is located at the header, and will therefore be on every single page. Even if pet owners or pet sitters do not know where to get started, we have made a FAQ (frequently asked questions) section to answer questions we believe are important to pet owners and pet sitters.
 <br> <br>
				<strong>How does website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?
</strong>
				 <br> <br>
The design of our website is also connected to our marketing and communication strategy. With our marketing and communication strategy we aim to create content that is simple but playful. From our interviews we have learned that especially the use of yellow in our logo and website design is considered playful, as well as the font we used for the headers in our website. And as mentioned before, after showing our prototype to our interviewees and our website to the participants in the testing fase, we learned that our participants found the website easy to use.                                                              <br> <br>
              <strong> How does the website design help showcase the unique value proposition of the product?   </strong>   
				   <br> <br>
				The unique value proposition of our service consists of finding a local trustworthy pet sitter and creating a community among pet sitters and pet owners. Our website design contributes to this via several design choices made based on our target audience. For example we used design elements such as trusted customer reviews, pictures and ID validation throughout the website to establish trustworthiness and reliability. Highlighting positive testimonials from both pet sitters and pet owners can reassure visitors about the quality of the service. Community building features like social media shortcuts of our brand where members can share tips, advice, and stories related to pet care. Also our website allows pet sitters to create detailed profile that showcases their experience, qualifications, and personality. Personalized profiles help foster a sense of community and connection between our members. In addition, localized visuals help to reflect on the local community where our service operates. This includes pictures of local neighborhoods which are visible via a map to emphasize the local aspect of the service.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>User interface patterns and the structure of the navigation and content</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				We use a responsive navigation bar with flexbox we chose here for consistent layout on different screen sizes. The navigation we used on all pages is a horizontal navigation layout for easy access and better user experience. We use spacing and styling for the navigation links, that&nbsp; is also for clarity and visual appeal. Research has shown that horizontal menus are natural and they are&nbsp; often used in website navigation, so users become familiar with them. We used a contrasting colour for the registration button to attract attention. The navigation is clear and provides easy access to different sections of the website. .<br>
				<br>
				  We chose for the Header design on the main page to use a background image with a gradient overlay for visual appeal.We use the principles of contrast and hierarchy by using a large, bold welcome text. The header on the main page has a search bar that allows users to search for pet stays based on location, dates and number of dogs. The search bar in the header allows users to quickly find pet stays based on their preferences. 
              <br>
				<br>
				We implemented a grid layout for organising pet-friendly cities and testimonials. 
				Below the header is a list of pet-friendly cities with images and links to the  cities pages. The grid layout is effective for listing multiple cities with images and associated links.Adding pet-friendly cities with images adds visual appeal and helps users discover the locations.  
				<br>
				<br>
				The testimonials section showcases customer testimonials in a carousel format with Swiper.js.  Testimonials add believability to the website and help build trust with potential users.  We chose Swiper.js with user experience (UX) in mind because it provides a smooth and interactive carousel experience for showing testimonials. Users have the ability to swipe left or right which increases user engagement and makes navigating through testimonials more enjoyable. We created visually appealing testimonial carousels that match the overall design aesthetic of the website. Swiper.js is responsive by default. The carousel was chosen for its seamless user experience, visual appeal, responsiveness, easy implementation and rich features.
				<br>
				<br>
				We have also added a call-to-action section to encourage users to become a dog sitter. The call-to-action provides a button for more information. The call-to-action encourages user engagement. CTAs are key to lead users to desired actions, such as signing up for a service or exploring additional content. We used contrasting colours and a clear message. We chose the CTA because CTA button stands out on the page, grabs the attention of users and it might triggers them to take action. Also, Research has shown that including a CTA helps increase website engagement. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The about us section on the main page provides a brief description of the website's services. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The footer contains links to social media, a menu with links to various pages and copyright. The footer provides important links and information, which improves the user-experience of the website.  The footer functions as the conclusion of the web page and provides additional navigation options.  The use of interactive social media icons, such as the spinning effect when you hover over them, adds a playful and attractive element to the footer.We chose this because this interactive behaviour catches the attention of users and encourages them to interact with the icons, making them more likely to follow the website's social media accounts. The playful aspect of the animation reflects the brand's personality and can leave a positive impression on users. 
				<br>
				<br>
				General we use media queries to adjust layout and styling for best viewing on different devices. We ensure elements are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes.
				<br>
				<br>
				On the pet sitters page, we use a grid layout to show information about pet sitters, which provides a more visually organised and structured layout of the content.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				We used a carousel for pagination to allow users to navigate through multiple pages of search results. We used this because the carousel is effective for showing a large amount of content within a limited space while maintaining user engagement and interaction. 
				
			
				
				<br>
				<br>
				We have also added a sidebar with filters options. Filters are crucial for refining search results and allow users to customise their experience based on specific criteria. Filters allow users to narrow down their options based on factors such as experience level of the pet sitter and available facilities. We also chose filters because they encourage user engagement by allowing them to interact with content creatively. Users can select and deselect filters to see how this affects the results, leading to a more interactive and engaging experience. Filters help users quickly find the information they need.
				<br>
				<br>
				We use cards for showing the profiles of the  pet sitters this improves the visual presentation and readability of the information. Each card contains details about the pet sitter, such as their name, description and rating, making it easy for users to select a suitable pet sitter.

				
				<br>
				<br>
				For the petsitter lisa and hans page, we use the section house details, which shows information about the specific petsitter by name.
It shows the sitter's name, location, ratings and reviews.
A photo gallery gives a visual representation of the sitter's home environment.We have also added a booking form to that.
A booking form allows users to enter their check-in and check-out dates, as well as the number of guests.
This form allows users to check the availability of the pet sitter's services.

We have created a list of additional details about the amenities and features offered by the pet sitter, such as happy home environment, experience and pet-friendly amenities.
Also, a Description where the pet sitter provides background information about the pet sitter, including their experience.
To find the pet sitter's location, we have added a map that shows the pet sitter's location on Google Maps, so users can look at the location where the petsitter lives.
Below the map is a short description.
At the bottom of the page is Information about the host being shown, including photo, reviews, number of reviews, response rate and response time.
Users can click on contact host to contact the host directly. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The gallery section uses a grid layout to display multiple images of the pet sitter's house. We used this because grids are a commonly used UI pattern for organising and presenting visual content in a structured way,  users can easily look at the images.  The "Check availability" form is placed under the pet sitter's details, making it easily accessible for users who want to book.

				
				
				<br>
				<br>
				On the faqpage, we have structured the FAQ section using an accordion layout, where each question serves as a clickable header that pops out to reveal the answer when selected. We chose this because this layout allows users to efficiently navigate through the FAQ section, focusing only on topics of the interest of the users. The FAQs are following  a logical order and are the common questions users may have about the service. With accordions, users can expand and collapse individual questions, giving them control over the amount of information they want to view at any given time

				<br>
				<br>
				The content on the about us page is structured hierarchically to convey information effectively. The page starts with a header introducing the team members, followed by individual profiles arranged in rows and columns. Each profile includes a photo, name,study title and links to social media, consistently presented on all cards. In addition, the page includes sections for the company's motto, mission, vision and values, presented in a visually distinctive way. We used grid layouts for team members to show the  individual profiles. Grid layouts are effective in presenting multiple pieces of content in a structured and visually appealing way. Each profile card is placed in a grid cell, for alignment and consistency. 
				<br>
				<br>
				We use animation effects to increase user engagement and visual appeal. When users mouse over interactive elements such as the team member cards or the values, mission and vision cards, hover effects are applied. This makes users feel interactivity. The team members cards undergo a transformation when the mouse is hovered over. This transformation adds dynamic to the website and draws attention to the interactive elements, triggering users to explore further. These effects create visual interest and direct their attention to important parts of the content. And that is why we chose to make it playful, which suits our brand.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				We created also a login page. The login form is structured with inputfields for username and password. A checkbox is provided for users to indicate whether they want the system to remember their login password. And below the login button, there's a link for users who don't have an account yet, directing them to the registration page. Users can create accounts and log in, after that we offer personalized experiences to the individual preferences. For example, users may have their favorite pet sitters saved, or they may receive recommendations based on their past interactions with the site. 
	            <br>
				<br>
				In the registration page  users have to input their information such as full name, username, email, phone number, password, and gender. This pattern is common for user registration. Each input field is with a label, creating a clear and natural user experience. We chose this pattern because it enhances usability by providing visual cues for users to understand what information is expected in each field. The gender selection utilizes radio buttons, allowing users to choose one option from multiple choices. The "Register" button is the submission button for the form. It follows the standard pattern for form submission, where users click the button to complete the registration process. When users hover over the submit button, the color change and these elements are interactive and responsive. Dynamic color changes make the registration form feel more interactive and engaging leading to a more satisfying user experience. 
				
				 <br>
				<br>
				In the contact form users can input their full name, email address, phone number, and message. This structure follows the conventional layout for contact forms, making it natural for users to provide their information and message. The use of Bootstrap classes ensures consistency and responsiveness.  Our website design present the principles of the design theory, we did research about it so that every element in our website is for its purpose and encourage the user experience. 
For example, using a responsive flexbox and media queries reflects to the concept of continuity from Gestalt psychology, creating a seamless experience across all devices. Horizontal navigation uses usability principles to make navigation in a natural way and effortless. 
The contrast colors of the call-to-action button have the principle of visual hierarchy and effectively which are grabbing users attention. Grid layouts and carousels organize content in a logical way and engage users. The animated effects add fun and interactivity. 
The consistent design patterns in our webste enhance our brand identity and user recognition. The authentication and personalization features create user centered design principles. Every design decision at SitAndStay prioritizes functionality and user satisfaction, ensuring that our webiste is functioning flawlessly and provide an excellent user experience.

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <p><strong>Overview</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			  The goal of this testing phase to challenge our website with different goals. We wanted to find out about the functionality and how easy it is for a user to navigate through our website. We used different goals in each testing and depending on the flow of the process we asked for more or less goals to accomplish. 
			<br>
			 <br>
				In total we had 4 participants. All of them are millennials and currently own a dog or owned a dog not too long ago. Some of the participants were also part of our problem and solution interview. So, they already knew about the brand. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
				The testing took part either on camps or at their house in and around breda. Our group agreed on recording the audio of the testing phase and to take photos during the completion of the goals. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
				We gave a short introduction to the brand, depending on if the participant were already in our problem or solution interviews. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
				In general, we can summarize that the navigation seemed very easy for our participants and every goal was done without any help by the team.
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <strong>Tasks for the user/participant 1:</strong>
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <u>Find yourself a dogsitter in Breda:</u> 
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  The participant could easily search via the location function and eventually found the right information through a few clicks. No difficulties here.  
			<br>
			  <br>
				<u>Register yourself as a member:</u>  
			<br>
			  <br>
			This was a trickier task because the participant did not know that this function can be found at the login button. Once she found that, the registration itself went easily and without any problems.
			<br>
			  <br>
				<u>Check in and out with pet sitter Hans:</u> 
			<br>
			  <br>
			This also went easily, partly because she already knew where to the page of the pet sitters. If this was not the case, she would have preferred the title of that page to change to a clearer name. 
			<br>
			  <br>
			<u>Find out where pet sitter Lisa lives:</u> 
			<br>
			  <br>
			This went well for the participant, she knew by task 1 where this pet sitter was on the website but finding the location took a bit longer. Eventually she managed to find it after some scrolling on the correct page. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <strong>Findings:</strong>
			<br>
			  <br>
			What the participant really liked about the style of the website is that it is clear because of the contrasting colours. The site is playful, which is also very much a lined with the dog theme. According to the participant, the location checker and ID validation were nice tools for using the service. This made it reliable and innovative. 
			<br>
			  <br>
			<strong>Improvements:</strong>
			<br>
			  <br>
			Things the participant would change is the title of the login button, it was not clear that you need to register yourself there. Therefore, an improvement would be to change the title to: Register here. Also, the participant felt the title of the product page did not fit our website, because our product is actually a service. The participant would change this title to: Our service.
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <strong>Tasks for the user/participant 2:</strong>
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <u>Find a petsitter in Breda</u> 
				<br>
			  <br>
				It was easy for the participant to find this information. They filled in the search bar on the home page, and found a petsitter.  
				<br>
			  <br>
				<u>Find out how much experience the petsitter you choose in the first exercise has.</u> 
				<br>
			  <br>
				This was easy as well to find for the participant. The scrolled down on the page of the profile page of Petsitter Hans, and found out through the symbols underneath the photos that Hans has 5 years of  experience with petsitting. 
				<br>
			  <br>
				<u>Login on Sit&amp;Stay</u>
				<br>
			  <br>
				This was easy to find as well since the log in page is located in the header, which is similar to other websites that have a login page.  
				<br>
			  <br>
				<u>Find more information on how to apply for Sit&amp;stay</u>
				<br>
			  <br>
				The partcipant was quick to find this information. They clicked on the text FAQ in the footer, and quickly learned on that page more about how to apply for Sit&amp;Stay. 
				<br>
			  <br>
				<strong>Findings: </strong>
				<br>
			  <br>
				The participant loved the colours from the website and mentioned that it makes her feel happy. Additionally, the participant mentioned that they found the website very easy to use, since it is very familiar to websites like Airbnb and Booking.com.  
				<br>
			  <br>
				<strong>Improvements:</strong>
				<br>
			  <br>
				Something we could improve according to our participant are things like an explanation on the website on how we choose our petsitters. They mentioned this since it is important for them to have this information to trust a petsitter via Sit&amp;Stay. Therefore, to summarize, the improvements mainly lay in the content of the website and not the design.  
				<br>
 				<br>
				<strong>Tasks for the user/participant 3:</strong>
				<br>
			  <br>
				At the beginning of the testing, I provided an overview of our brand and the services we offer. This included a brief explanation of our brand identity and the types of services available to users. I outlined the structure of the testing process, emphasizing that participants would be required to navigate the website independently. Next, I informed the participant that I would not provide assistance or answer questions about the website during the testing period. 
				<br>
			  <br>
				<u>Finding a Petsitter in Breda</u> 
				<br>
			  <br>
				The participant navigated to the main page and located the search box for the desired location, Breda. She entered the necessary details such as dates and the number of dogs. Upon clicking the search button, she was directed to the petsitters page. She selected a petsitter named Lisa from the list. The participant completed the goal effortlessly in under one minute and indicated that it was an easy task. 
				<br>
			  <br>
				<u>User Registration</u>
				<br>
			  <br>
				The participant clicked on the "Login" option on the main page. She then proceeded to click on the "Register" button. The participant successfully completed the registration process within a minute. 
				<br>
			  <br>
				<strong>Findings</strong>
				<br>
			  <br>
				The participant demonstrated efficiency in completing both tasks within the given time frame. She indicated that the tasks were straightforward and did not encounter any difficulties. The participant's seamless navigation through the website suggests a user-friendly interface. The quick completion of tasks reflects positively on the website's usability and accessibility. 
				<br>
			  <br>
				<strong>Improvements</strong>
				<br>
			  <br>
				No major issues were encountered during this testing session.  
				<br>
			  <br>
				<strong>Tasks for the user/participant 4:</strong> 
				<br>
			  <br>
				I started the testing part with a short introduction about our brand and the service we are offering to our customers. After that I explained the goal for this testing round and stated that we do not want to help or answer questions during the process because we would like the website to be self-explanatory. Participant number one already took part in the problem and solution interview as she owns a dog herself. 
				<br>
			  <br>
				<u>Find a dogsitter in Breda.</u>  
				<br>
			  <br>
				She went through the search function on the main page and put in how many dogs she has, the date of her vacation and in which city she would like to search for a sitter. After clicking on search, she was directed to the sitters and chose one of the profiles. She managed to complete the goal without any problems in less than a minute. 
				<br>
			  <br>
				<u>Make an account on the Sit&amp;Stay website.</u> 
				<br>
			  <br>
				She immediately clicked on the login button in the top right corner and needed a few seconds to find the register now button. This way she completed the second goal fast as well. Based on this testing round the website works very well and is easy accessible for people who have never used it before.  
				<br>
			  <br>
				<strong>Findings</strong>
				<br>
			  <br>
				The biggest issue for this testing phase is that the website is not fully usable, and some buttons lead into nothing. For example, the login or register button as well as the cities to find a pet sitter besides Breda. As both goals were easily completed and there where no visible struggles for the participant I assume design is very clear and the customer gets a good overview. 
				<br>
			  <br>
				<strong>Improvements</strong>
				<br>
			  <br>
				The main improvement is to make the website fully accessible to make the search easier and clearer. It currently looks like all buttons are clickable even though only a few are actually working. Due to the moment the first needed a few more seconds to get from the login page to the register page while completing the second goal this could be improved in the future as well. The register button needs to be more visible so the customer does not struggle making an account.

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
			<p><strong>Campaign on social media:</strong></p>
          	<p>In the Lifes of Dutch Millennials, balancing work, social life, their beloving partner and the love for their furry companions can be a challenge. Our campaign aims to connect Dutch Millennials who own dogs with reliable and trustworthy pet sitters, ensuring their pets are well cared for when they're away. Through a mix of engaging content, we'll create a community-driven initiative that resonates with dog owners across the Netherlands.
			<br>
			<br>
			Our target audience treats their pets like their own kids, they give them love, food, playtime and lots of cuddles. However, pet owners also want a night out or a day off. Therefore, they need a pet sitter. Nevertheless, most dog owners are not very keen on dog hotels, and especially for a day or night off, this is too expensive. Therefore, Sit&amp;Stay provides a local pet sitter for them. Our message is: You can leave your kid comfortably in the hands of a pet sitter from Sit&amp;Stay. With this message we want to create brand awareness, so that next time our target audience needs a pet sitter, they’ll choose Sit&amp;Stay.
			<br>
			<br>
			Message: Pet owners treat their pets like their own kids. However, pet owners also want a night out or a day off. Sit&amp;Stay provides a local pet sitter for them.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Promotional activities:</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			Content creating and sharing: Our brand created engaging and relevant content such as Instagram posts, TikTok videos and graphics that highlight the features and benefits of our service. With sharing the content, we used hashtags for every post to engage with our followers. We also shared content across our TikTok and Instagram account. We shared videos from our TikTok account on our Instagram story to highlight them and create conversion between the two platforms. We also used TikTok to share reels generated on Instagram to see how the view and likes differ from each other, as the algorithm and structure of these two platforms are very different. 
			<br>
			<br>
			User generated content: Potential customers gave permission to our brand to post their dogs on social media with the experience they should have with the use of our service. We asked them to send pictures and videos of their dogs to use for content, we created slides show (Professionalism 2.3 and 2.5) and video content (Professionalism 2.10, 2.9 and 2.7) that show the viewer the experience of Sit&amp;Stay. We choose this approach because we want our user to have the feeling of a trustworthy platform. Via this way it becomes more accessible for a user to visit our service because many people had gone before them and share their reviews. Via this user generated content, the viewer should get the feeling of transparency and trustworthiness.
			<br>
			<br>
			Social media trends: The brand Sit&amp;Stay wanted to partly focus it on trends. We played with the trend “what I eat in a day “and changed it to “What a dog eats in a day” (Professionalism 2.4) to connect dogs with the trend. After this we also used the trend “What my dog does during the day” (Professionalism 2.11) and post it on TikTok. For Instagram we used two weekly trends like: Tongue Out Tuesday and Throwback Thursday. We also created a hashtag for this trend.<br>
			<br>
			Cross promotion: Our Instagram received a direct message from another dog related Creative Business brand called: Arbor Paws. They asked us to collaborate on Instagram, we agreed to promote each other via our Instagram stories. Both parties posted one Instagram story at the same time. This way we extended the reach of each account and posts to gain more views and engagement with the generated content.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Communcation objective: Brand awareness</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Reach objectives:</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			Instagram: We want to reach 120 likes in total for all posts on Instagram with our social media campaign for the brand Sit&amp;Stay by the 5th of April 2024 in the Netherlands. 
			<br>
			<br>
			TikTok: We want to reach a total of one thousand views on TikTok posts for the brand Sit&amp;Stay by the 5th of April 2024 in the Netherlands.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Response objectives:</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			Instagram: We want to achieve 20 comments on all Instagram posts for the entire campaign by the 5th of April 2024 in the Netherlands.
			<br>
			<br>
			TikTok:  We want to reach a total of 20 saves on all our posted TikTok's before the 5th of April in the Netherlands.<br>
			<br>
			Affect objective: We want to increase awareness among our target audience regarding the need for a pet sitter for a relaxed day off or night out through targeted marketing campaigns and social media content by the 5th of April 2024 in the Netherlands.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Explanation chosen platforms:</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Instagram:</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			Instagram is an essential social media platform for targeting Millennials due to their visual communication, social connection, personal expression, influence on trends and mobile accessibility (Statistics, 2020). Brands that understand and effectively leverage these platforms can establish meaningful connections with Millennial consumers and drive engagement and loyalty. Instagram is centered around visual content, which resonates strongly with Millennials. Millennials tend to engage more with visual content than with text-based content. This aligns with the generational preference for quick, visually stimulating information consumption (Monga, 2024).
			<br>
			<br>
			Millennials value social connections and relationships. Instagram, while primarily visual, also facilitates interaction through likes, comments, direct messages, and stories (Wade, 2017).
			<br>
			<br>
			Millennials are known for their desire for self-expression and personal branding. Instagram provides features for individuals to showcase their identities through profile customization, photo sharing, and status updates. This aspect is especially important for millennials who often use these platforms to express their opinions, showcase their lifestyles, and build their own personal brands (Log in or Sign up to View, n.d.). Millennials are heavily influenced by social media trends and peer recommendations. Instagram, but also TikTok, are influential platforms where trends, opinions, and recommendations spread rapidly. Brands targeting Millennials can leverage this influence by actively participating in these platforms and engaging with users through relevant content.  Instagram has a highly functional mobile app, catering to the mobile-centric behavior of millennials. As mobile devices are the primary means of accessing the internet for many millennials, the accessibility and user-friendliness of these apps make them indispensable for reaching this demographic (McLachlan, 2024). 
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Approach:</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			Post consistent: Maintain a consistent posting schedule to keep your audience engaged and attract new followers. Experiment with different posting times and days to determine when your audience is most active. We posted on Instagram every other day to stick to a regular schedule and regular content for our followers. On TikTok we did not stick to a specific time to post, which will be elaborate later in this document. But even though we did not time the posts precisely, we posted content every day for the last week. It had a bit of a rough start as TikTok was not planned in from the beginning and was more of a replacement for Facebook. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Use relevant hashtags: Research and use relevant hashtags in your posts to expand your reach and attract users interested in your content. Mix popular hashtags with niche-specific ones to reach a broader yet targeted audience (Geyser, 2024). For our posts we mostly used the hashtags: #sitandstay #dog #pet #petstagram #doglover and #petlover. We tried to be consistent with these hashtags so the algorithm will recognise our content and we can easier reach our audience.
			<br>
			<br>
			Optimize your profile: Ensure your Instagram profile is complete, including a clear profile picture (logo), a descriptive bio (slogan etc.), and a link to your website or landing page.
			<br>
			<br>
			We created a profile with our profile picture, without the slogan to make it more catchy and easier to identify. The first thing in our bio is the name of our brand and a short description so the Instagram users do not need to search for information while visiting our profile. Everything is visible immediately. Then we added some smileys and key points to make it more engaging. To make conversion to our TikTok account and website as easy as possible we created a Link tree.
			<br>
			<br>
			Analyse the performance: Regularly monitor your Instagram insights to track the performance of your posts and identify trends. Meta provides us to get insight in the statistics of our Instagram page, so we can check our reaches and impacts our posts have. We were able to see all insight on our Instagram page but on TikTok we have limited access to the insights. (for further information, see professionalism)
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>TikTok:</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			It seems TikTok permeates across all age groups, also Millennials, but there is a generation gap there that visibly reflects in the behavior of each demographic on the app, and the content surfaced to them. Millennials are the original Internet Kids. They were born between the early 80s and mid-90s, so they're currently all grown up and in their late 20s to early 40s. They're the ones who remember dial-up internet days and also adapted this to the digital age. When it comes to consuming content, Millennials have a different taste than, for example Gen Z. Millennials in general consume the most content from people with the same interests; these posts are mainly about food, sports, households, travel etc. All the topics where other Millennials can get along. Another high score on the Millennial categories is meme accounts and small businesses (TikTok Marketing to Gen Z Vs. Millennials, n.d.). According to an article uploaded by TikTok itself, also content about music, food/cooking and comedy is very important to engage with Millennials. As for hashtags, one of the most popular hashtags in 2021 on TikTok was #dog (Up Close and Personal with the Millennials on TikTok (Creative Strategies, n.d.).
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>TikTok approach:</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			Crafting a social media campaign specifically for TikTok allows our brand Sit&amp;Stay to make use of the creativity and the viral potential of the platform. Our TikTok social media campaign is targeting Millennials in the Netherlands. The platform TikTok allows us creativity: Embrace TikTok's creative features such as filters, effects, music, and editing tools to produce visually captivating and entertaining content. Storytelling approach: Tell compelling stories and experiences that evoke emotions and spark conversations among Millennials, this drives engagement and brand affinity. Incorporate humour: Use humour and capture the attention of Millennials, funny pictures, memes, jokes, and light-hearted content to create a memorable brand experience (TikTok For Business, 2024).
			<br>
			<br>
			TikTok content strategy: Relatability: Create authentic and relatable content that resonates with Millennials, showcasing the brand's personality and values. Our brand does this via user generated content. Nostalgia and trends: Join relevant TikTok challenges and trends (POV, picture slide shows etc.) and create branded challenges to encourage user participation and engagement. Ask questions to our followers like: “Would you sit this dog?” And “meet this dog, like and follow for more”. Experience related content: Encourage our target audience, that are Millennials, to create and share their own content related to our brand Sit&amp;Stay, utilise user-generated content to increase reach and awareness.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Facebook</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			Facebook and Instagram are essential social media platforms for targeting millennials due to their visual communication, social connection, personal expression, influence on trends and mobile accessibility. Brands that understand and effectively leverage these platforms can establish meaningful connections with millennial consumers and drive engagement and loyalty. Millennials value social connections and relationships. Facebook, as one of the earliest and most established social media platforms, offers a comprehensive suite of tools for social interaction, including messaging, groups, events, and pages. Instagram, while primarily visual, also facilitates interaction through likes, comments, direct messages, and stories. (further information below)</p>

			<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>What did you learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign?
			<br>
			<br>
			During the duration of the project, we learned some important things about the use of social media for marketing purposes. Since our entire team consists out of Gen Z’ers, all of us were already familiar with the platforms we used during this project to execute our social media campaign, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Nevertheless, all of us had never used these platforms before for marketing purposes, and only for personal use. As we are also not part of our chosen target audience, we needed to rely mainly on research and experimenting with different type of posts and content.
			<br>
			<br>
			One of the most important things we learned during this project was that reaching your target audience, or even an audience at all, on Instagram is not as simple as we thought. In this case the expectations that we had of using this method were higher than the results we got. While we learned that reaching people on Instagram was more difficult than we thought, we also learned that reaching a lot of users on TikTok was easier than we thought. With just two TikTok posts, we had already achieved our reach objective. In this part we will dive deeper into these learning points to reflect on our learning process during this project.
			<br>
			<br>
			What worked and what didn’t?
			<br>
			<br>
			To reflect on the learning process of our social media campaign we take a look at all social media platforms we used: Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. In this section we specifically talk about worked well and what did not.
			<br>
			<br>
			We started our marketing campaign by using Instagram and Facebook, since according to research these were the two most popular social media platforms among our target audience. To begin with Instagram, we first started posting mainly ‘real-life experiences of our customers’. After research we found out that this is what appeals most to Millennials who use Instagram. Additionally, to experiment, we also posted a picture and caption that was fully generated by AI. This worked, since we were quickly able to reach an audience with both types of posts. Nevertheless, most accounts that we reached were not likely to be our target audience for our social media campaign. We believe this, since a large amount of our followers and likes are from brands that were also created by second year Creative Business students and family member or friends from our team. However, the goal was to reach users on Instagram via our posts, and we were able to do that.
			<br>
			<br>
			Unfortunately, Facebook did not work as well as we had hoped, or maybe it is better to say, not at all. To create an account for our brand on Facebook, was already difficult, since you first need to make a personal account. Only then you can create a ‘brand page’ on Facebook. When this was finally set up, we were only able to post two photos, until we got suspended. According to Meta we had violated the ‘Community Guidelines’. We created a new Facebook account and started posting. Unfortunately, again after two posts, we got suspended for the same reason as mentioned before. Since the Community Guidelines are not well explained by Meta, we were not able to figure out exactly in what terms we violated the rules of the platform. Since we do not have access to our Facebook account anymore, and the posts are deleted, it is difficult for us to look at how many people we exactly reached with our posts. Nevertheless, we do remember that this number was very low (approximately between 1 and 8 users). One of the reasons for this was also that had we only posted two time. Which was why, next to the amount of time we had spent on Facebook, this did not damage our campaign too much. After this, we were advised by our lecturer to move to a different platform, TikTok. <br>
			<br>
			Luckily for us, TikTok turned out to be a great success for our platform. Our communication objective was to create brand awareness, and therefore we wanted to reach a lot of views on our posts. With only a few posts we were able to achieve our reach objective for TikTok. However, there was a big difference in success of a few of our posts. The views on our posts where you could only see the logo of our brand and in the caption a summary of our brand reached a very low number of users in comparison to the funny and cute content of dogs we posted. We think that the reason behind this is the fact that a logo does not have an impact on people’s emotions. However, content that is funny or contains a cute dog playing, influences people's emotions. Therefore, we think that people engage more with emotional content. To summarize, we learned that TikTok is a great platform to reach a large number of people, and that content that can affect people’s emotions in a positive way is very popular.
			<br>
			<br>
			What went as expected and what didn’t?
			<br>
			<br>
			One of the things that worked well as expected was the use of funny and cute content. We started of with this type of content on TikTok. We noticed that this type of content was working very well by looking at the amounts of views we would get within a certain time frame. Therefore, we decided to also start posting a few of the same TikToks on Instagram. We expected this to work since we see on social media platforms that mainly memes and content of adorable animals have a lot of likes.
			<br>
			<br>
			One of the things that did not work as well as we expected was the use of hashtags in Instagram captions. When we created our posts, we used hashtags in order to reach our target audience, since we know from research that the use of hashtags for Instagram posts will help the algorithm to show our posts on our target audience’s feed. Nevertheless, we did not reach as big of an audience as we thought we would. We thought that we would be able to reach approximately 100 users. Nevertheless, the number of users we reached with our first Instagram post was 37 (Professionalism 1.1). At first, we thought that this might had something to do with the content of our post, since we decided to have AI create our first post. The photo and caption were generated by AI. Nevertheless, when we uploaded our second post, which was fully created by our team, the number of users we reached turned out to be 40 (Professionalism 1.2). Lastly for Instagram, our last post was a stock photo. We uploaded a stock photo to see if there would be a difference in the number of accounts we reach with our posts. We noticed that it took longer for this post of a stock photo, it took longer to reach the number of users that we would normally reach within 12 hours. Nevertheless, this could also be because the last time we posted something on Instagram was three days before the stock photo post. In comparison to the amount of time in between our other posts this is a day longer. Meaning we might have lost engagement with our followers. Unfortunately, due to the deadline for this project, there was not enough time to continue experimenting with posting stock photos on Instagram.
			<br>
			<br>
			What would you do differently?
			<br>
			<br>
			There are also a few things that we would like to slightly adjust and keep for our social media campaign. One of those things is the use of AI. We used AI to generate two complete posts, of which one was for Instagram and the other one for Facebook. We saw that this type of content did not influence our statistics negatively, but it also did not reach as many people as the posts we made ourselves. Therefore, we would like to use AI in the future as a tool. Since, although it does not create the best type of posts for our social media campaign, we do believe that using it as a tool to generate ideas for posts could work very well, since the ideas that AI creates are based on a lot of information from databases. Something that we would definitely keep within our social media campaign for our brand Sit&Stay;is using content that is funny and/or cute. As mentioned earlier, we saw that using these two types of content work very well in comparison to more abstract content such as a simple logo with an introduction of the brand as a caption. Even in a few interviews and during a few classes we would see people happily smiling when they would see one of the pictures of the cute dogs that we had post on Instagram. This would lead to people having a very positive image of our brand. Consequently, also due to our use of colours, they would associate our brand with the emotion; happiness.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>What will we do in the future? (new things)
			<br>
			<br>
			In the future we would like to try some new things out for our social media marketing campaign. During this project we were very much focused on the type of content we created, and not when we would post this content. We would like experiment with this is the future to see, for instance, if a post that was uploaded in the afternoon gets more likes than a post that was uploaded at night.
			<br>
			<br>
			Another thing we would like to try in the future is starting our own hashtag. By creating a unique hashtag for our social media campaign, we could possibly create an even stronger brand. Additionally, with this hashtag we could start a trend where social media users use this hashtag. Following, we could gain more exposure if this hashtag would have our brand name in it.
			<br>
			<br>
			Lastly, we would like to try collaborating with influencers in the future. We see that other brands often collaborate with influencers to increase their brand awareness. We would like to try this to see if this could also work for our brand. Therefore, we would like to specifically collaborate with influencers that have pets themselves.
			<br>
			<br>
			What would we change or keep from the campaign?
			<br>
			<br>
			We tried to make a Facebook account for our Brand Sit&amp;Stay, but after trying the first time we got suspended immediately. We thought the reason behind this was that Facebook is strict on using IA for posts and other content. Facebook is sensitive according to AI and has stricter rules on it than Instagram although this is also a Meta owned platform. However, we created another account we're we did not make use of any AI related content. It worked for at least 2 posts. But we got suspended again. After making 2 Facebook accounts with different E-mail addresses, Facebook suspended our account due to community guidelines. However, Facebook did not tell us what exact rules we violated. In total, we tried to create 3 accounts and they were all rejected. We decided as a group to adjust our marketing tactics and use another platform to market the brand. As a result, a media objective is adjusted, and the content calendar is also again adjusted to the new approach. We now use TikTok as our second social media platform to market our brand Sit&amp;Stay.
			<br>
			<br>
			So due to the issues, we had with our Facebook account we started using TikTok, which was not the platform that we expected to use but was definitely the most successful one. Therefore, what we would change about our campaign, is the use of platforms. Although we have noticed the importance of having a target audience for a social media campaign, we were very focused on the platforms that our target audience was active on. Nevertheless, after using TikTok, perhaps we should also use social media platforms for our brand that our target audience is less active on. Since, as a starting brand, we would like to gain brand awareness among a broader audience with our social media campaign. For that reason, it is also good to take a look at a platform such as TikTok since it is easier to reach a broader audience on TikTok. Following, a broader audience will get to know our brand, which creates the opportunity for people who think positively about our brand (through social media content) to talk positively to their family members and friends about Sit&amp;Stay.
			<br>
			<br>
			Did we reach our goal? And reflect on it.
			<br>
			<br>
			Communcation objective: Brand awareness
			<br>
			<br>
			Overall, we believe that we were able to reach brand awareness, since we were able to 	reach people through our social media content. Nevertheless, whether we reached brand awareness among our target audience is difficult to determine. For Instagram we state clearly that we are most likely to have not created brand awareness among our target audience, since as mentioned earlier, the audience we reached were not our target audience. For TikTok, we were able to reach a lot of people, and therefore create brand awareness. However, we do not have insight into the demographics of the users we reached on TikTok. Meaning we are not clear on what kind of users we reached.
			<br>
			<br>
			Instagram: We want to reach 120 likes in total for all posts on Instagram next month with our social media campaign for the brand Sit&amp;Stay by the 5th of April 2024 in the Netherlands.
			<br>
			<br>
			No, we were not able to achieve this objective. We believe that we did not reach this due to the fact that we mainly reached other brands and friends/family members via Instagram. We were not able to reach a lot of people that we did not know personally and were not aware of our brand for this project. Additionally, looking at the statistics, we saw that there was only one post that one user found via the explore page on Instagram. The reason why this was only one person, and not more is something we are not certain about.
			<br>
			<br>
			TikTok: We want to reach a total of one thousand views on TikTok posts for the brand Sit&amp;Stay by the 5th of April 2024 in the Netherlands.
			<br>
			<br>
			YES, by the 5th of April we reached a total of 5172 views on all our TikToks for Sit&amp;Stay. As mentioned before, we did see a difference in statistics when posting a different type of 	content (for example, the logo). Therefore, we believe that we were able to meet this objective by using engaging content, such as using trends as ‘What I Eat In A Day’ and ‘A Day In My Life’, and the use of trending hashtags like ‘#VoiceEffects’ and ‘#dog’.
			<br>
			<br>
			Instagram: We want to achieve 20 comments on all Instagram posts for the entire campaign by the 5th of April 2024 in the Netherlands.
			<br>
			<br>
			NO, we were unfortunately not able to meet this objective. We believe that we were not 	able to reach this objective, since our followers and accounts we reached mainly consisted 	out of other brands created by BUas Creative Business students and family members or friends from our team. We believe that these users mainly watched our content and followed our brand on Instagram to support our team, and therefore did not feel the need to comment on our posts since the subject of our brand and content (dog sitting) itself might not really speak to them.
			<br>
			<br>
			TikTok: We want to reach a total of 20 saves on all our posted TikTok's before the 5th of April in the Netherlands. <br>
			<br>
			No, we did not achieve this objective. We believe that this might be because the content of certain posts was not important enough for users to save. For instance, we saw that our TikTok of where we explain how to use our service had more saves than a TikTok showing 	what a dog eats in a day. The information that we provided to user on how to use our service is more important in case users would like to use the service in the future. Therefore, we think that this is the reason behind users saving this specific post.
			<br>
			<br>
			Affect (Feel) objective: We want to increase awareness among our target audience regarding the need for a pet sitter for a relaxed day off or night out through targeted marketing campaigns and social media content by the 5th of April 2024 in the Netherlands.
			<br>
			<br>
			This objective is difficult to measure since we do not have the time to check this with people from our target audience that viewed the post. Nevertheless, it is most likely that 	we did not achieve this. Since, as explained earlier, we mainly reach people on Instagram that were not in our target audience, and for TikTok we do not have insights on the demographics of our target audience. Based on this information, we think that we were not able to achieve the objective.</p>

				  <strong>Changes that have been made in the second version:</strong>
				 <br>
				<br>
				  <strong>Solutions:</strong> we made a pivot in our solution according to the solution interviews. Our first solution was a big scale platform where pet sitters and pet owners could connect. Based on our interviews the target audience would not trust a total stranger with their pet, so we changed it to a local base solution to create a trustworthy community.  
				  <br>
				<br>
<strong>Key metrics:</strong> The first key metric did not measure the organizations performance only when users make use of the customer care. So, we changed it to reviews and rankings.
				   <br>
				<br>
<strong>Cost structure:</strong> We changed advertising costs to marketing costs because advertising is not a cost me make as an organization, but for promoting our service we do make use of marketing.  
				   <br>
				<br>
<strong>Revenue stream:</strong> Our brand does not have partnerships yet, so we added a membership subscription as a revenue stream.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Finding a trustworthy dog sitter </li>
            <li>Connecting with other dog owners </li>
			  <li>People who cannot own a dog themselves, can spend time with one</li>
		  </ul>
			
			  <p><strong>Existing alternatives:</strong></p>
				<ul>
			     <li>There are some platforms that provide a service where pet owners can find a pet sitter worldwide. Websites like: Petsitter.com, Trustedhousesitter.com and Rover.com.  </li>
            <li>Existing Facebook groups that connect dog owners on the platform. As a pet owner you have the ability to join such a group.   </li>
			  <li>Via the websites named above a user also has the ability to connect with a pet owner to sit the pet for a certain amount of time.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our solution is a website on which dog owners can find trustworthy dog sitters and the other way around. You can create a profile on which you can present yourself as a dogsitter and write a description about you and your possible experience. Another option is to create a display of your dog and when you need a dog sitter. People can leave reviews on both sides to make the process more transparent. The website will operate locally in the Netherlands/ in cities and towns. We choose this to increase trustworthiness because our brand operates on a local base. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our target audience are dog owners. To specify this audience, we decided on focusing on Dutch people between the age of 27 and 34 years old.  </li>
            
          </ul>
					<img src="images/management/customersegment.png" alt="customer" height="400">
	
				 
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>From the user perspective our website provides a pet sitter and pet owner community. Our users have the ability to find a pet sitter on a local base to take care of their pet when the owners are for example on a night out. On the other hand, pet lovers who do not own a pet have to opportunity to sit a pet for an amount of time. This connects local pet lovers on the platform. After the experience the got from this platform the users leave review and share experiences on the platform to inform other users and share recommendations. Our website Sit and Stay provides a trustworthy community where users can share their experiences.  </li>
            <li>Our target audience are Millennial pet owners who are trying to find a pet sitter for a night out or weekend trip. Pet owners do not have to freedom to go wherever they want because they have responsibility for their pet. Via the platform we connect pet owners and pet sitters on a local base, users who search for a pet sitter can find it via the Sit and Stay platform.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our brand created a transparent policy via a registration idea where the customer needs to complete an ID verification. This makes sure that our value of customer transparency is reached, and we distinguish our brand from other existing platforms that do not have this function.  </li>
			  <li>An advantage our platform wants to create is a trustworthy customer base. Our brand is locally based and only connects pet lovers within their own neighbourhood. This ensures that our users build a trustworthy connection with each other and via sharing experiences they create a community. Our users also write reviews and recommendations that helps other (new) users to get to know the users and the platform.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We use our own online platform (website) to provide our service. We use social media accounts on the platforms like TikTok and Instagram for our marketing/promotion of our product. Originally, we had planned to use Facebook instead of TikTok since this is the most used platform among our target audience, however due to being suspended multiple times on this platform, we unfortunately weren’t able to continue our promotion on Facebook.  </li>
            <li>On our website customers can use our service, and they can find more information about our brand and service. </li>
			  <li>On Instagram we mainly promote our service by sharing experiences from previous consumers by sharing videos on Instagram Stories or photos as Instagram Posts.  </li>
			  <li>On TikTok we promote our brand by sharing funny memes and adorable user generated content of pets. After the issues that occurred with our Facebook account, we were advised to use TikTok by our marketing lecture Mathijs, since the younger people from our target audience is very active on TikTok.  </li>
          </ul>
			  <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We measure our success via the reviews and experiences from our website users. Our customers have the possibility to leave reviews and share experiences via features on our website. Via this we can measure the feelings and experiences users had due to our service.  </li>
            <li>Another key metric is the number of registrations our service got in our website. Our users should registrate themselves.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Advertising revenue model: We will advertise different dog and pet related brands on our website. For example, Frolics or Royal Canin as popular Dutch dogfood brands or Pets Place as a famous pet store in the Netherlands. This way we can generate revenue by promoting them to our customers. These advertisements will be shown on the free and subscripted version on our website. </li>
			  <li>Revenue stream--Subscription Fees: This is the revenue earned from charging customers regular fees for access our service over a specific period (monthly/annual) on our membership-based website.  </li>
			  <li>Subscription revenue model: Annual/ monthly subscriptions to the website. Without a subscription you can only see very few recommended places and sitters, as well as the “about us” page. When purchasing a subscription, you can see all sitters and all places available to sit on the platform without any hidden information. You are able to contact someone and also leave reviews based on your experience. To subscribe to our website, you need to fill in your personal information and go through a verification process. You need to scan both sides of your ID and it will take around half an hour until the account is activated and ready to use. To make your own account more attractive for others you can also link your other social media accounts to your sit and Stay account. </li>
			  <li>Revenue stream -- Advertising Revenue: Revenue earned from selling advertising space or time to advertisers. This can include for example: display ads, sponsored content, pay-per-click or advertising. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed costs</strong>-- <strong>Website:</strong> monthly costs to web domain and provided host (Github) costs.Web domain costs: 20 euro per year (Meer, 2024).<strong> Github enterprise costs:</strong> 214,38 Euro per year (Pricing · Plans for Every Developer, n.d.) 
			  <br><br>
				
				<strong>Fixed costs</strong>-- Marketing: These costs remain consistent because we will use social media advertisement to promote our service, which is paid. For our marketing we will need employees and budget to execute our marketing campaigns. 
				<br><br> <strong>Costs social media campaign advertisement: </strong>

Cost per view Instagram: €7,00 per thousand views. (One media, 2021) 

Cost per click Instagram: €350 per thousand clicks.    (One media, 2021) 

Cost per click TikTok: Average of € 0.20 per click. (Heisa beheer, 2024) 

As our company is a startup, we aim to reach 20.000 clicks on Instagram and 10.000 on clicks TikTok for our campaign executed on Instagram and TikTok in 2025.   

Costs- 20.000 x 0.35 = 7.000 
Costs - 10.000 x 0.20 = 2.000 
Total campaign costs € 9.000 euros
				<br><br>
				<strong>Marketing employees:</strong>

€1850 a month salary for the marketing employee (junior marketeer for a startup brand) (Nationale beroepengids, 2021).  

2 marketing employees means- 1850 x 2 = 3.700,00  
3700 x 12 = € 44.400  
			  <br><br>
				<strong>Variable costs</strong>- Partnership/ collaboration: We collaborate with influencers all around the Netherlands to have a bigger reach. This way the influencer can promote our website and show possible experiences they had while using our website. As stated in the marketing plan we will make use of this for our future executed campaign so we will not calculate this in our cost per unit at this moment, because we did not spend this cost until now.  
<br><br>
Formula cost per unit: total costs/ number of units <br>
Total costs: 44.400 + 9.000 + 214,38 + 20= € 53.634,38  
<br> <br>
Number of units: This contains subscriptions of our service. Unfortunately, we have not been able to launch our website and therefore have no indication of potential memberships. Based on our Instagram followers and saves on our TikTok posts. We can conclude that we have 38 (Instagram followers) + 4 (saves on TikTok) = 42 memberships for this year. That means that our number our units is 42 x 100 euros (for annual membership) = € 4200,--  
		    </li>
            <li>Cost per unit: 44.400/4200= € 10,57 </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We provide a trustworthy pet sitter platform in a local community. Users can find a trusted pet sitter in their local community. This contributes our unique value proposition because our platform creates a trustful pet sitter and pet owner community. Via our service our target audience can easily find a local pet sitter and therefore the pet owner has the opportunity to have a day/night off. We give pet owners more freedom to go wherever they want and give pet lovers the responsibility for the pet.  </li>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>Validation of Assumptions
 
We chose our trademark, Sit&amp;Stay, including our logo, based on the service we provide. The service we provide to petowners is a database of petsitters open to take care of the pet(s) of petowners while they are away. Since our target audience is specifically dogowners, and it is common that dogowners tell their dog to sit and stay, we chose this as our name for our brand. This shows a kind of familiarity, which already creates the feel of a brand about pets, since the phrase ‘Sit and stay’ is associated with pets. In addition to this, since Sit&amp;Stay is a service that provides petsitters, we want the pet(s) of petowners to sit and stay at a home of a Sit&amp;Stay petsitter for a comfortable stay for the pet(s).
 
As for our logo, this logo includes our name and the a few colours of our colour palette. The logo is a simple graphic design which makes it easy to remember. This is important since we aim to spread brand awareness with our marketing and communication plan. Therefore our trademark needs to be simple, so it is easy to recognise. This way, next time a petowner needs a petsitter, they will hopefully remember our brand.
 
An example of an already existing petsitting brand is 'TrustedHousesitters'. Their trademark is very different in comparison to the one for our brand. The name of their brand is not specifically about pets or other animals in general, and their logo is a house. Within the house is a heart, resembling a mouth, and above the house are two little eyes. Therefore the logo of this brand shows 3 things in one, a house, a heart, and a happy face. This logo probably aligns with their values. This is something we did not take as much into account as the brand 'TrustedHousesitters'. We did chose to show a happy dog in our logo, to show that we value happy dogs who had a nice experience with petsitters from our brand. Nevertheless, this is only one of our values, while 'TrustedPetsitters' shows more of their values in their logo. 
 
Another already existing petsitting service is 'PetBacker'. Their logo is a paw (most likely of a dog). The paw aligns with the fact that they are a petsitting brand focused on dogs. The name of the brand includes the word pet, which also shows that it is a brand about/for pets. In comparison to 'TrustedHousesitters' the logo of this brand does not show their values and only a relation between their service. </p>
