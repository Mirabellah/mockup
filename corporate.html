          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Color Scheme: <br>
              </strong>The colors we chose are playing an important role in our brand's identity and personality. Our website use the shades of yellow (#FFCF00), blue (#C4DDEF), light green (#D9E0A2), dark green (#485613), light brown(#DBB377) and complementary colors such as white (#FFF) and black (#000) for text contrast.
 <br><br>
#FFCF00 The bright yellow color refers to the sun shining. #C4DDEF refers to a blue sky. These two colors combined resemble a time where the weather is nice for dogs and their owners to take a beautiful walk. According to our interviews pet owners have the most enjoyment with their dogs during a walk with nice weather, therefore we choose colors that evokes this feeling. #D9E0A2 This light green refers to the favourite kind of playground for every single dog, good amount of fresh grass. #485613 The dark green shows the dirt every dog loves playing in. #DBB377 The light brown resembles dogs and dogfood. Many of our colours were chosen by looking at certain elements that dogs like, because we have learned from our interviews that a happy dogs makes a happy dog owner.
 <br><br>
Additionally, according to research, the colors we use evoke feelings of energy, trustworthiness, happiness. For example yellow is associated with warmth and happiness. Based on feedback from participants who tested our website, the color yellow was mentioned as a significant factor contributing to happiness. They said that they felt more happier and more uplifted when encountering this color scheme. Light blue gave the participants a relaxing, trustworthy feeling. This aligns with the brand's values and personality. Similarly, they noted that the color light green contributed to a sense of freshness and tranquility during their  experience. Light brown added a sense of warmth, comfort, and reliability to the design. All of this is also aligns with the values of our brand.
			<br> <br>	
	<strong>How does website design fit the values and personality of the brand?</strong>

<br> <br>				
The values of our brand are:
Customer transparency
Our brand is creating a new form of pet sitting where pet owners invite guests to take care of their pet for a certain amount of time. Transparency is necessary to create a sense of safety between pet owners, pet sitters and their pets.
Bringing together local pet owners
Create a local pet community where our audience can communicate and share their passion for pets.
Pet, pet owner and pet sitter wellbeing
We work hard to ensure the wellbeing of our audience which is pets, pet owners and pet sitters. We want to create a comfortable and safe experience.
With these values, we aim to create a feeling of happiness. We aim to achieve this feeling by creating comfort and trust between our brand, pet owners and pet sitters. The design of the website fits well with this, for instance, since it is very easy to use. Immediately when you open our website you can fill in your location, departure, return, and number of pets and click on the search icon. For pet owners it is very easy to find the pet sitter they need. In addition to this, it is also easy for pet sitters to start on Sit&Stay, since the login page for pet sitters is located at the header, and will therefore be on every single page. Even if pet owners or pet sitters do not know where to get started, we have made a FAQ (frequently asked questions) section to answer questions we believe are important to pet owners and pet sitters.
 <br> <br>
				<strong>How does website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?
</strong>
				 <br> <br>
The design of our website is also connected to our marketing and communication strategy. With our marketing and communication strategy we aim to create content that is simple but playful. From our interviews we have learned that especially the use of yellow in our logo and website design is considered playful, as well as the font we used for the headers in our website. And as mentioned before, after showing our prototype to our interviewees and our website to the participants in the testing fase, we learned that our participants found the website easy to use.                                                              <br> <br>
              <strong> How does the website design help showcase the unique value proposition of the product?   </strong>   
				   <br> <br>
				The unique value proposition of our service consists of finding a local trustworthy pet sitter and creating a community among pet sitters and pet owners. Our website design contributes to this via several design choices made based on our target audience. For example we used design elements such as trusted customer reviews, pictures and ID validation throughout the website to establish trustworthiness and reliability. Highlighting positive testimonials from both pet sitters and pet owners can reassure visitors about the quality of the service. Community building features like social media shortcuts of our brand where members can share tips, advice, and stories related to pet care. Also our website allows pet sitters to create detailed profile that showcases their experience, qualifications, and personality. Personalized profiles help foster a sense of community and connection between our members. In addition, localized visuals help to reflect on the local community where our service operates. This includes pictures of local neighborhoods which are visible via a map to emphasize the local aspect of the service.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>User interface patterns and the structure of the navigation and content</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				We use a responsive navigation bar with flexbox we chose here for consistent layout on different screen sizes. The navigation we used on all pages is a horizontal navigation layout for easy access and better user experience. Proper spacing and styling of navigation links is also for clarity and visual appeal. Research has shown that horizontal menus are intuitive and often used in website navigation, so users become familiar with them. We used a contrasting colour for the registration button to attract attention. The navigation is clear and provides easy access to different sections of the website. .<br>
				<br>  We chose for the Header design on the main page to use a background image with a gradient overlay for visual appeal.We use the principles of contrast and hierarchy by using a large, bold welcome text. The header on the main page includes a search bar that allows users to search for pet stays based on location, dates and number of dogs. The search bar in the header allows users to quickly find pet stays based on their preferences. 
                <br>
				<br>
				We implement a grid layout for organising pet-friendly cities and testimonials. 
Below the header is a list of pet-friendly cities with images and links to the individual cities' pages. The grid layout is effective for listing multiple cities with images and associated links.Adding pet-friendly cities with images adds visual appeal and helps users discover destinations.  
				<br>
				<br>
				The testimonials section showcases customer testimonials in a carousel format with Swiper.js.  Testimonials add believability to the website and help build trust with potential users.  We chose Swiper.js with user experience (UX) in mind because it provides a smooth and interactive carousel experience for showing testimonials. The ability to swipe left or right on touch-enabled devices or click navigation buttons increases user engagement and makes navigating through testimonials more enjoyable. It also allows us to create visually appealing testimonial carousels that match the overall design aesthetic of the website. Swiper.js is responsive by default and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. The carousel was chosen for its seamless user experience, visual appeal, responsiveness, easy implementation and rich features.
				<br>
				<br>
				We have also added a call-to-action section to encourage users to become a dog sitter. The call-to-action provides a link for more information. The call-to-action encourages user engagement. CTAs are key to lead users to desired actions, such as signing up for a service or exploring additional content. We used contrasting colours and a clear message. The CTA button stands out on the page, grabs the attention of users and triggers them to take action. Research has shown that including a CTA helps increase website engagement. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The about us section on the main page provides a brief description of the website's services. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The footer contains links to social media, a menu with links to various pages and copyright. The footer provides important links and information, which improves the user-friendliness of the website.  The footer functions as the conclusion of the web page and provides additional navigation options.  The use of interactive social media icons, such as the spinning effect when you hover over them, adds a playful and attractive element to the footer. This interactive behaviour catches the attention of users and encourages them to interact with the icons, making them more likely to follow the website's social media accounts. The playful aspect of the animation reflects the brand's personality and can leave a positive impression on users. 
				<br>
				<br>
				General we use media queries to adjust layout and styling for best viewing on different devices. We ensure elements are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes.
				<br>
				<br>
				On the pet sitters page, we use a grid layout to show information about pet sitters, which provides a more visually organised and structured layout of the content.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				We used a carousel for pagination to allow users to navigate through multiple pages of search results. We used this because the carousel is effective for showing a large amount of content within a limited space while maintaining user engagement and interaction. 
				
			
				
				<br>
				<br>
				We have also added a sidebar with filters options. Filters are crucial for refining search results and allow users to customise their experience based on specific criteria. Filters allow users to narrow down their options based on factors such as experience level of the pet sitter and available facilities. We also chose filters because they encourage user engagement by allowing them to interact with content creatively. Users can select and deselect filters to see how this affects the results, leading to a more interactive and engaging experience. Filters help users quickly find the information they need. By allowing users to refine their needs with filters.  
				<br>
				<br>
				We use cards for displaying profiles of pet sitters this improves the visual presentation and readability of the information. Each card contains details about the pet sitter, such as their name, description and rating, making it easy for users to select a suitable pet sitter.

				
				<br>
				<br>
				For the petsitter lisa and hans page, we use a section or house details, which displays information about the specific petsitter by name.
It shows the sitter's name, location, ratings and reviews.
A photo gallery gives a visual representation of the sitter's home environment.We have also added a booking form to that.
A booking form allows users to enter their desired check-in and check-out dates, as well as the number of guests.
This form allows users to check the availability of the pet sitter's services.

We have attached A list of additional details about the key amenities and features offered by the pet sitter, such as happy home environment, experience and pet-friendly amenities.
Also, a Description where the pet sitter provides background information about the pet sitter, including their experience.
To find the pet sitter's location, we have added a map that shows the pet sitter's location on Google Maps, so users can visualise the area where their pet would be staying.
Below the map is a short description.
At the bottom of the page is Information about the host being shown, including photo, reviews, number of reviews, response rate and response time.
Users can click on contact host to contact the host directly. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The gallery section uses a grid layout to display multiple images of the pet sitter's house. We used this because grids are a commonly used UI pattern for organising and presenting visual content in a structured way, allowing users to easily browse images.  The "Check availability" form is placed intuitively under the pet sitter's details, making it easily accessible for users who want to book.

				
				
				<br>
				<br>
				On the faqpage, we have structured the FAQ section using an accordion layout, where each question serves as a clickable header that pops out to reveal the answer when selected. We chose heir because this layout allows users to efficiently navigate through the FAQ section, focusing only on topics of interest to users. The distribution of FAQs follows a logical order and addresses common questions users may have about the services offered. With accordions, users can expand and collapse individual questions, giving them control over the amount of information they want to view at any given time

				<br>
				<br>
				The content on the about us page is structured hierarchically to convey information effectively. The page starts with a header introducing the team members, followed by individual profiles arranged in rows and columns. Each profile includes a photo, name,study title and links to social media, consistently presented on all cards. In addition, the page includes sections for the company's motto, mission, vision and values, presented in a visually distinctive way. We used grid layouts for team members to show the  individual profiles. Grid layouts are effective in presenting multiple pieces of content in a structured and visually appealing way. Each profile card is placed in a grid cell, maintaining alignment and consistency. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The website features animation effects to increase user engagement and visual appeal. When users mouse over interactive elements such as the team member cards or the values, mission and vision cards, hover effects are applied. This makes users feel interactivity. The team members' cards undergo a transformation when the mouse is hovered over. This transformation adds dynamism to the web and draws attention to the interactive elements, triggering users to explore further. These effects create visual interest and direct their attention to important parts of the content. And that is why we chose to make it playful, which suits our brand.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				We created also a login page. The login form is structured with inputfields for username and password. A checkbox is provided for users to indicate whether they want the system to remmeber their login credentials. And below the login button, there's a link for users who don't have an account yet, directing them to the registration page. By allowing users to create accounts and log in, sitandstay can offer personalized experiences to individual preferences. For example, users may have their favorite pet sitters saved, or they may receive recommendations based on their past interactions with the site. 
	            <br>
				<br>
				The registration page allowing users to input their information such as full name, username, email, phone number, password, and gender. This pattern is common for user registration and data submission. Each input field is accompanied by a label, creating a clear and intuitive user experience. We chose this pattern because it enhances usability by providing visual cues for users to understand what information is expected in each field. The gender selection utilizes radio buttons, allowing users to choose one option from multiple choices. This pattern is suitable for selecting exclusive options, such as gender. The "Register" button serves as the submission button for the form. It follows the standard pattern for form submission, where users click the button to complete the registration process. When users hover over the submit button, the color change and hese elements are interactive and responsive. Dynamic color changes make the registration form feel more interactive and engaging leading to a more satisfying user experience. 
				
				 <br>
				<br>
				The contact form allows users to input their full name, email address, phone number, and message. This structure follows the conventional layout for contact forms, making it intuitive for users to provide their information and message. The use of Bootstrap classes ensures consistency and responsiveness.

				  <strong>Changes that have been made in the second version:</strong>
				 <br>
				<br>
				  <strong>Solutions:</strong> we made a pivot in our solution according to the solution interviews. Our first solution was a big scale platform where pet sitters and pet owners could connect. Based on our interviews the target audience would not trust a total stranger with their pet, so we changed it to a local base solution to create a trustworthy community.  
				  <br>
				<br>
<strong>Key metrics:</strong> The first key metric did not measure the organizations performance only when users make use of the customer care. So, we changed it to reviews and rankings.
				   <br>
				<br>
<strong>Cost structure:</strong> We changed advertising costs to marketing costs because advertising is not a cost me make as an organization, but for promoting our service we do make use of marketing.  
				   <br>
				<br>
<strong>Revenue stream:</strong> Our brand does not have partnerships yet, so we added a membership subscription as a revenue stream.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Finding a trustworthy dog sitter </li>
            <li>Connecting with other dog owners </li>
			  <li>People who cannot own a dog themselves, can spend time with one</li>
			  <br>
			  <p><strong>Existing alternatives:</strong></p>
			     <li>There are some platforms that provide a service where pet owners can find a pet sitter worldwide. Websites like: Petsitter.com, Trustedhousesitter.com and Rover.com.  </li>
            <li>Existing Facebook groups that connect dog owners on the platform. As a pet owner you have the ability to join such a group.   </li>
			  <li>Via the websites named above a user also has the ability to connect with a pet owner to sit the pet for a certain amount of time.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our solution is a website on which dog owners can find trustworthy dog sitters and the other way around. You can create a profile on which you can present yourself as a dogsitter and write a description about you and your possible experience. Another option is to create a display of your dog and when you need a dog sitter. People can leave reviews on both sides to make the process more transparent. The website will operate locally in the Netherlands/ in cities and towns. We choose this to increase trustworthiness because our brand operates on a local base. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our target audience are dog owners. To specify this audience, we decided on focusing on Dutch people between the age of 27 and 34 years old.  </li>
            
          </ul>

          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>From the user perspective our website provides a pet sitter and pet owner community. Our users have the ability to find a pet sitter on a local base to take care of their pet when the owners are for example on a night out. On the other hand, pet lovers who do not own a pet have to opportunity to sit a pet for an amount of time. This connects local pet lovers on the platform. After the experience the got from this platform the users leave review and share experiences on the platform to inform other users and share recommendations. Our website Sit and Stay provides a trustworthy community where users can share their experiences.  </li>
            <li>Our target audience are Millennial pet owners who are trying to find a pet sitter for a night out or weekend trip. Pet owners do not have to freedom to go wherever they want because they have responsibility for their pet. Via the platform we connect pet owners and pet sitters on a local base, users who search for a pet sitter can find it via the Sit and Stay platform.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our brand created a transparent policy via a registration idea where the customer needs to complete an ID verification. This makes sure that our value of customer transparency is reached, and we distinguish our brand from other existing platforms that do not have this function.  </li>
			  <li>An advantage our platform wants to create is a trustworthy customer base. Our brand is locally based and only connects pet lovers within their own neighbourhood. This ensures that our users build a trustworthy connection with each other and via sharing experiences they create a community. Our users also write reviews and recommendations that helps other (new) users to get to know the users and the platform.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We use our own online platform (website) to provide our service. We use social media accounts on the platforms like TikTok and Instagram for our marketing/promotion of our product. Originally, we had planned to use Facebook instead of TikTok since this is the most used platform among our target audience, however due to being suspended multiple times on this platform, we unfortunately weren’t able to continue our promotion on Facebook.  </li>
            <li>On our website customers can use our service, and they can find more information about our brand and service. </li>
			  <li>On Instagram we mainly promote our service by sharing experiences from previous consumers by sharing videos on Instagram Stories or photos as Instagram Posts.  </li>
			  <li>On TikTok we promote our brand by sharing funny memes and adorable user generated content of pets. After the issues that occurred with our Facebook account, we were advised to use TikTok by our marketing lecture Mathijs, since the younger people from our target audience is very active on TikTok.  </li>
          </ul>
			  <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We measure our success via the reviews and experiences from our website users. Our customers have the possibility to leave reviews and share experiences via features on our website. Via this we can measure the feelings and experiences users had due to our service.  </li>
            <li>Another key metric is the number of registrations our service got in our website. Our users should registrate themselves.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Advertising revenue model: We will advertise different dog and pet related brands on our website. For example, Frolics or Royal Canin as popular Dutch dogfood brands or Pets Place as a famous pet store in the Netherlands. This way we can generate revenue by promoting them to our customers. These advertisements will be shown on the free and subscripted version on our website. </li>
			  <li>Revenue stream--Subscription Fees: This is the revenue earned from charging customers regular fees for access our service over a specific period (monthly/annual) on our membership-based website.  </li>
			  <li>Subscription revenue model: Annual/ monthly subscriptions to the website. Without a subscription you can only see very few recommended places and sitters, as well as the “about us” page. When purchasing a subscription, you can see all sitters and all places available to sit on the platform without any hidden information. You are able to contact someone and also leave reviews based on your experience. To subscribe to our website, you need to fill in your personal information and go through a verification process. You need to scan both sides of your ID and it will take around half an hour until the account is activated and ready to use. To make your own account more attractive for others you can also link your other social media accounts to your sit and Stay account. </li>
			  <li>Revenue stream -- Advertising Revenue: Revenue earned from selling advertising space or time to advertisers. This can include for example: display ads, sponsored content, pay-per-click or advertising. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed costs</strong>-- <strong>Website:</strong> monthly costs to web domain and provided host (Github) costs.Web domain costs: 20 euro per year (Meer, 2024).<strong> Github enterprise costs:</strong> 214,38 Euro per year (Pricing · Plans for Every Developer, n.d.) 
			  <br><br>
				
				<strong>Fixed costs</strong>-- Marketing: These costs remain consistent because we will use social media advertisement to promote our service, which is paid. For our marketing we will need employees and budget to execute our marketing campaigns. 
				<br><br> <strong>Costs social media campaign advertisement: </strong>

Cost per view Instagram: €7,00 per thousand views. (One media, 2021) 

Cost per click Instagram: €350 per thousand clicks.    (One media, 2021) 

Cost per click TikTok: Average of € 0.20 per click. (Heisa beheer, 2024) 

As our company is a startup, we aim to reach 20.000 clicks on Instagram and 10.000 on clicks TikTok for our campaign executed on Instagram and TikTok in 2025.   

Costs- 20.000 x 0.35 = 7.000 
Costs - 10.000 x 0.20 = 2.000 
Total campaign costs € 9.000 euros
				<br><br>
				<strong>Marketing employees:</strong>

€1850 a month salary for the marketing employee (junior marketeer for a startup brand) (Nationale beroepengids, 2021).  

2 marketing employees means- 1850 x 2 = 3.700,00  
3700 x 12 = € 44.400  
			  <br><br>
				<strong>Variable costs</strong>- Partnership/ collaboration: We collaborate with influencers all around the Netherlands to have a bigger reach. This way the influencer can promote our website and show possible experiences they had while using our website. As stated in the marketing plan we will make use of this for our future executed campaign so we will not calculate this in our cost per unit at this moment, because we did not spend this cost until now.  
<br><br>
Formula cost per unit: total costs/ number of units <br>
Total costs: 44.400 + 9.000 + 214,38 + 20= € 53.634,38  
<br> <br>
Number of units: This contains subscriptions of our service. Unfortunately, we have not been able to launch our website and therefore have no indication of potential memberships. Based on our Instagram followers and saves on our TikTok posts. We can conclude that we have 38 (Instagram followers) + 4 (saves on TikTok) = 42 memberships for this year. That means that our number our units is 42 x 100 euros (for annual membership) = € 4200,--  
			  </li>
            <li>Cost per unit: 44.400/4200= € 10,57 </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We provide a trustworthy pet sitter platform in a local community. Users can find a trusted pet sitter in their local community. This contributes our unique value proposition because our platform creates a trustful pet sitter and pet owner community. Via our service our target audience can easily find a local pet sitter and therefore the pet owner has the opportunity to have a day/night off.
